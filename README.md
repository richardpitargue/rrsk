# **[rrsk]** Richard's ReactJS Starter Kit
rrsk is a simple and unonpinionated ReactJS starter kit useful for frontend developers who like to experiment (like me!). Since it is unopinionated, you are free to modify anything to your liking.

1. `npm start` boots up webpack-dev-server on port 8080 (by default) on your local machine. It should also automatically open your browser.

## To-Do List
- [ ] Implement unit testing
